1)
create template by search area, replacing $(table), $(alias), $(what):

table = "contact"
alias = "c"
what = "*"

select $(what) from $(table) $(alias) $(joins) where $(where)

2) 
obtain $(joins) and $(where) from fields:

e.g.

fields are =

  a) first_name
  b) company_name
  c) phone


$(joins):
  a) join contact_info ci on c.id = ci.contact_id
  b) join record_catalog rc on c.id = rc.id
     join company co on co.id = rc.company_id
  c) join contact_info ci on c.id = ci.contact_id
     join contact_personal_info cpi on c.id = cpi.contact_id

$(where):
  a) ci.first_name
  b) co.name
  c) ci.work_tel, cpi.home_telephone


3)
merge joins and make them unique (maintain order!):
     join contact_info ci on c.id = ci.contact_id
     join record_catalog rc on c.id = rc.id
     join company co on co.id = rc.company_id
     join contact_personal_info cpi on c.id = cpi.contact_id

4)
combine fields columns with operators and names
if there are 2+ fields -> combine them with "or"
get where clause

(do not forget escaping of "quote", etc.)


5) append to where clause
additional clauses: company id, filtering
-- maybe using the same framework: make internal predicates

6) apply read own (?)

7) apply paging
